I am not committed to any extracurricular activities at school, \r\nI did some here and there like lane student advisory board, urban eco, and stage crew.\r\nDuring the spring of my junior year I was an intern at the Shedd Aquarium teen learning lab.\r\n I got a chance to go behind the scenes, take picture of the aquarium after hours, and look \r\n through shedd's archives. At the end of my term, i got to present my project I did on shedd \r\n architecture, to shedd employees, and other interns.\r\nI attended the Chicago and Police Firefighter Academy through the school year, for a semester\r\n at the fire academy and the police academy. At the Police we learned how to properly hold a gun, \r\n how to arrest someone, police protocol and self defense. At the Fire academy we learn how to climb a ladder, \r\n how to work together and navigate through a smoking building, how to rescue someone out of a car using the proper \r\n equipment and more!\r\n </b>\r\n</p>\r\n <img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.n\r\net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/544319_153188478181323_328022746_n.jpg?oh=86a30ac14531891c9a46aca7db713583&oe=56522F0A\" alt=\"Smile\r\ny face\" height=\"302\" width=\"262\">\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n<h2> GWC MP3 Projects </h2>\r\n<h4> Click on project learn more! </h4>\r\n<a href=\"file:///Users/ada/Downloads/MP3.html\"><img src=\"http:\r\n//i62.tinypic.com/e063on.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\"height=\"302\" width=\"202\"></a>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
