<h2> About Me</h2>
<div>
<p><b>My name is Jasmine white, I attended lane tech college prep. I am not committed to any extracurricular activities at school, 
I did some here and there like lane student advisory board, urban eco, and stage crew.
During the spring of my junior year I was an intern at the Shedd Aquarium teen learning lab.
 I got a chance to go behind the scenes, take picture of the aquarium after hours, and look 
 through shedd's archives. At the end of my term, i got to present my project I did on shedd 
 architecture, to shedd employees, and other interns.
I attended the Chicago and Police Firefighter Academy through the school year, for a semester
 at the fire academy and the police academy. At the Police we learned how to properly hold a gun, 
 how to arrest someone, police protocol and self defense. At the Fire academy we learn how to climb a ladder, 
 how to work together and navigate through a smoking building, how to rescue someone out of a car using the proper 
 equipment and more!
